# ❌ Tic Tac Two ⭕️

This is a digital version of a board game, built as a university assignment. Two players (or you vs a bot!) battle it out on a 5x5 board using a movable 3x3 grid and your best strategic skills ;D

> For now the JavaScript, TypeScript (vanilla) versions are available, Vue 3 + TS vesion in process...

## 📜 Rules of the game

The game board is **5x5** cells, but the action happens inside a **movable 3x3 grid**. <br>
Each player can place up to 4 pieces on the board. <br>
For the first **two** moves players are only allowed to place their Xs and Os. After each player placed two pieces on the grid, they can:
- **Place** a new piece
- **Move** a piece they already placed
- **Move** the grid up, down, left or right

First to align **3 of their pieces in a row** (inside the grid) wins! <br>
Each player has **10 seconds** to make a move — so think fast! <br>
You can play in **Player vs Player** or **Player vs AI** mode.
